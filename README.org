* pooler - An OTP Process Pool Application

The pooler application allows you to manage pools of OTP behaviors
such as gen_servers, gen_fsms, or supervisors, and provide consumers
with exclusive access to pool members using pooler:take_member.

** What pooler does

*** Protects the members of a pool from being used concurrently

The main pooler interface is =pooler:take_member/0= and
=pooler:return_member/2=.  The pooler server will keep track of which
members are *in use* and which are *free*.  There is no need to call
=pooler:return_member= if the consumer is a short-lived process; in
this case, pooler will detect the consumer's normal exit and reclaim
the member.  To achieve this, pooler tracks the calling process of
=take_member= as the consumer of the pool member.  Thus pooler assumes
that there is no middle-man process calling =take_member= and handing
out the member pid to another worker process.

*** Maintains the size of the pool

You specify an initial and a maximum number of members in the pool.
Pooler will create new members on demand until the maximum member
count is reached.  New pool members are added to replace member that
crash.  If a consumer crashes, the member it was using will be
destroyed and replaced.  Pooler will remove members that have not been
used in =cull_after= minutes.  Culling of members will not reduce a
pool below the initial size.

*** Manage multiple pools

A common configuration is to have each pool contain client processes
connected to a particular node in a cluster (think database read
slaves).  Pooler will randomly select a pool to fetch a member from.
If the randomly selected pool has no free members, pooler will select
a member from the pool with the most free members.  If there is no
pool with available members, pooler will return =error_no_members=.

** Motivation

The need for pooler arose while writing an Erlang-based application
that uses [[https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/][Riak]] for data storage.  Riak's protocol buffer client is a
=gen_server= process that initiates a connection to a Riak node.  A
pool is needed to avoid spinning up a new client for each request in
the application.  Reusing clients also has the benefit of keeping the
vector clocks smaller since each client ID corresponds to an entry in
the vector clock.

When using the Erlang protocol buffer client for Riak, one should
avoid accessing a given client concurrently.  This is because each
client is associated with a unique client ID that corresponds to an
element in an object's vector clock.  Concurrent action from the same
client ID defeats the vector clock.  For some further explanation,
see [[http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2010-September/001900.html][post 1]] and [[http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2010-September/001904.html][post 2]].  Note that concurrent access to Riak's pb client is
actual ok as long as you avoid updating the same key at the same
time.  So the pool needs to have checkout/checkin semantics that give
consumers exclusive access to a client.

On top of that, in order to evenly load a Riak cluster and be able to
continue in the face of Riak node failures, consumers should spread
their requests across clients connected to each node.  The client pool
provides an easy way to load balance.


** Usage and API

*** Pool Configuration

Pool configuration is specified in the pooler application's
environment.  This can be provided in a config file using =-config= or
set at startup using =application:set_env(pooler, pools,
Pools)=. Here's an example config file that creates three pools of
Riak pb clients each talking to a different node in a local cluster:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  % pooler.config
  % Start Erlang as: erl -config pooler
  % -*- mode: erlang -*-
  % pooler app config
  [
   {pooler, [
           {pools, [
                    [{name, "rc8081"},
                     {max_count, 5},
                     {init_count, 2},
                     {start_mfa,
                      {riakc_pb_socket, start_link, ["localhost", 8081]}}],
  
                    [{name, "rc8082"},
                     {max_count, 5},
                     {init_count, 2},
                     {start_mfa,
                      {riakc_pb_socket, start_link, ["localhost", 8082]}}],
  
                    [{name, "rc8083"},
                     {max_count, 5},
                     {init_count, 2},
                     {start_mfa,
                      {riakc_pb_socket, start_link, ["localhost", 8083]}}]
                   ]}
             %% if you want to enable metrics, set this to a module with
             %% an API conformant to the folsom_metrics module.
             %% If this config is missing, then no metrics are sent.
             %% {metrics_module, folsom_metrics}
          ]}
  ].
#+END_SRC

Each pool has a unique name, an initial and maximum number of members,
and an ={M, F, A}= describing how to start members of the pool.  When
pooler starts, it will create members in each pool according to
=init_count=.

*** Using pooler

Here's an example session:

#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
application:start(pooler).
P = pooler:take_member(),
% use P
pooler:return_member(P, ok).
#+END_SRC

Once started, the main interaction you will have with pooler is through
two functions, =take_member/0= and =return_member/2=.

Call =pooler:take_member()= to obtain a member from a randomly
selected pool.  When you are done with it, return it to the pool using
=pooler:return_member(Pid, ok)=.  If you encountered an error using
the member, you can pass =fail= as the second argument.  In this case,
pooler will permanently remove that member from the pool and start a
new member to replace it.  If your process is short lived, you can
omit the call to =return_member=.  In this case, pooler will detect
the normal exit of the consumer and reclaim the member.

*** Alternative usage

In many cases the resources within the pool will be used in the fashion
listed in the previous example. Given that this method is so common, the
helper function =use_member/1= wraps up this functionality do avoid
repetitive code.

Example session:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
application:start(pooler).
Result = pooler:use_member(fun(P) -> riakc_pb_socket:fetch(P, <<"bucket">>, <<"key">>) end).
#+END_SRC

#+OPTIONS: ^:{}

*** Metrics
You can enable metrics collection by adding a =metrics_module= entry
to pooler's app config. Metrics are disabled by default. The module
specified must have an API matching that of the [[https://github.com/boundary/folsom/blob/master/src/folsom_metrics.erl][folsom_metrics]] module
in [[https://github.com/boundary/folsom][folsom]] (to use folsom, specify ={metrics_module, folsom_metrics}}=
and ensure that folsom is in your code path and has been started. 

When enabled, the following metrics will be tracked:

| Metric Label                  | Description                                                                 |
| pooler.POOL_NAME.take_rate    | meter recording rate at which take_member is called                         |
| pooler.error_no_members_count | counter indicating how many times take_member has returned error_no_members |
| pooler.killed_free_count      | counter how many members have been killed when in the free state            |
| pooler.killed_in_use_count    | counter how many members have been killed when in the in_use state          |
| pooler.event                  | history various error conditions                                            |
